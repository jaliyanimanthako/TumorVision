# TumorVision

🧠 Welcome to TumorVision, a groundbreaking project at the intersection of deep learning and healthcare technology!

## Introduction
TumorVision is a cutting-edge web application designed to detect brain tumors swiftly and accurately. Our platform utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to analyze MRI scan images uploaded by users, swiftly identifying the presence of glioma tumors, meningioma tumors, pituitary tumors, or confirming the absence of any tumor.

## Features
- Swift and accurate detection of brain tumors using deep learning algorithms.
- Supports identification of glioma tumors, meningioma tumors, pituitary tumors, or confirms the absence of any tumor.
- Seamless and intuitive user experience crafted with Flutter.
- Expert handling of model training and image processing using Python, PyTorch, and OpenCV.
- Flask serves as the bridge between the front end and back end, with ngrok facilitating seamless communication.

## Team
- **Chathura Devinda**: Front-end developer, responsible for crafting a seamless and intuitive user experience using Flutter.
- **Jaliya Nimantha**: Back-end developer, handling model training and image processing using Python, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

## Current Stage
TumorVision is currently in the development stage. We have successfully crafted a prototype application that demonstrates our vision. With an overall model accuracy ranging between 60-70%, TumorVision promises to revolutionize the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors, potentially saving countless lives.
