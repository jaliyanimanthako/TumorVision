# TumorVision

ðŸ§  Welcome to TumorVision, a groundbreaking project at the intersection of deep learning and healthcare technology!

## Introduction

TumorVision is a cutting-edge web application designed to detect brain tumors swiftly and accurately. Our platform utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to analyze MRI scan images uploaded by users, swiftly identifying the presence of glioma tumors, meningioma tumors, pituitary tumors, or confirming the absence of any tumor.

## Tumor Types Detected

### Glioma Tumors
Gliomas are a type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord. They arise from glial cells, which surround and support nerve cells. Gliomas are categorized based on the type of glial cell involved and can range from relatively benign to highly malignant. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

### Meningioma Tumors
Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. They are typically slow-growing and are often benign. However, their location can lead to significant neurological problems, making early detection important for managing potential complications.

### Pituitary Tumors
Pituitary tumors develop in the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain. These tumors can affect hormone levels and lead to a variety of health issues. While many pituitary tumors are benign, their impact on hormonal balance necessitates prompt identification and treatment.

### Absence of Tumor
In addition to identifying specific types of tumors, TumorVision can also confirm the absence of any tumor, providing peace of mind to patients with clear MRI scans.

## Features
